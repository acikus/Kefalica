# Browser Games

This directory contains browser-based versions of games from the original Tkinter project.

## Basic Operations
Open `basic_ops.html` in a modern web browser. The page presents addition and subtraction problems with answer buttons, tracking score and attempts. No build step is required; all logic is implemented in `basic_ops.js`.

## Counter
Open `counter.html` to play a simple counting game. Click circles to toggle their color and choose plus or minus to combine the two rows. The game updates the result automatically. No build step is required; all logic is implemented in `counter.js`.

## Memory
Open `memory.html` to play a memory matching game. Click cards to reveal emojis and find all matching pairs. All logic is implemented in `memory.js`.

## Snake
Open `snake.html` to play the classic Snake game. Use the arrow keys to steer the snake, eat food, and grow. The score increases with each piece of food. All logic is in `snake.js` with no build step required.
